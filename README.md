This project is designed to provide a robust and flexible solution for managing user roles, permissions, 
and other critical infrastructure components commonly needed in backend systems.
At present, the framework has implemented Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and basic infrastructure setup. 
These foundational features are being gradually enhanced to support more advanced functionality, making the system more adaptable and scalable for a wide range of use cases.
